# Imagetransmission_over_5G_mobile_communication_using_MLalgorithms

This project widely oriented on wireless 5G communication. While transmitting a signal through a wireless medium we know that it faces different adverse situations like fading and noise etc.
Which leads to the degradation of signal quality and gives us worse output at receiver end.
In order to minimize these problems there are several solutions out of which we have tried to implement one of them.
We used adaptive modulation technique using various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM in order to reduce noise and fading effect and to reduce Bit error probability.
With this our model can predict suitable modulation scheme to demodulate our signal at the receiver end.
We have incorporated Additive White Gaussian Noise and Rayleigh fading distribution in order to mimic real world challanges.
